# Improvements

Below are some of the areas I feel needs to be changed in this design:

- **Different SORT fields for web and mobile**
  The different types of sort creates _inconsistency_ in user experience when the user wants to switch from web to mobile or vice versa. So letting the user to <u>sort based on the same way in both web and mobile is necessary</u>.

- **Search ICON in the input is unnecessary.**
  Its better if the user gets the data once they select a date range. Select a date range and then click search to apply filters is a bit long process.

- **Ancient design**
  Design of the table is feature wise very good, design is good too but in mobile the buttons _(attachment, next '>')_ are a bit small and will certainly cause error in visibility or touch. Its a good thing to have too many things in only one row of the table but operating with it may be hard.
